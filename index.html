Sure, here are short snippets of Java code to create a basic Street class and HTML code to embed a video playing button:

Java Street class:
```java
public class Street {
    private String name;
    private int length;
    
    public Street(String name, int length) {
        this.name = name;
        this.length = length;
    }
    
    public void displayStreetInfo() {
        System.out.println("Street Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Street Length: " + length + " meters");
    }
}
```

HTML code with a video playing button:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Video Player</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Click the play button to watch the video:</h1>
    <video width="320" height="240" controls>
        <source src="your_video_file.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</body>
</html>
```

These are basic examples to get you started with Java class and HTML code for a video playing button.
